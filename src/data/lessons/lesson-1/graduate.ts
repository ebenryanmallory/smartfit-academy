// NOTE FOR FUTURE AI:
// When defining lesson sections with code blocks, always use unescaped backticks (`) to open and close the template literal string.
// All triple backticks for code blocks inside the string must be escaped (\`\`\`).
// For example:
//   content: `Some text...\n\`\`\`python\ncode here\n\`\`\``
// This convention avoids accidental termination of the template literal and is the required style for all lessons in this codebase.
