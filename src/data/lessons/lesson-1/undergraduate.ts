      content: `Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents one of the most significant technological developments of our time. At its core, AI refers to computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, including learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

**Defining Intelligence in Machines**
Intelligence in AI systems manifests through several key capabilities:
- **Perception**: Processing and interpreting sensory data (vision, speech, text)
- **Learning**: Acquiring knowledge and skills from experience and data
- **Reasoning**: Drawing logical conclusions and making inferences
- **Planning**: Developing strategies to achieve specific goals
- **Communication**: Understanding and generating natural language

**Historical Context and Evolution**
The field of AI emerged in the 1950s with pioneers like Alan Turing, who proposed the famous "Turing Test" as a benchmark for machine intelligence. The journey from rule-based expert systems to today's neural networks represents decades of research breakthroughs, computational advances, and algorithmic innovations.

**AI vs. Human Intelligence**
While AI excels in specific domains like pattern recognition and data analysis, human intelligence remains superior in areas requiring creativity, emotional understanding, and contextual reasoning. Modern AI systems are "narrow" in scope, designed for specific tasks rather than general-purpose reasoning.`
