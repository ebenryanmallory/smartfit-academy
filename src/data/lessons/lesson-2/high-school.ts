// NOTE FOR FUTURE AI:
// When defining lesson sections with code blocks, always use unescaped backticks (`) to open and close the template literal string.
// All triple backticks for code blocks inside the string must be escaped (\`\`\`).
// For example:
//   content: `Some text...\n\`\`\`python\ncode here\n\`\`\``
// This convention avoids accidental termination of the template literal and is the required style for all lessons in this codebase.

      title: "What is Programming?",
      content: `Programming is the process of designing and building executable computer instructions to accomplish specific tasks. It involves:

- **Problem Solving**: Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps
- **Logical Thinking**: Creating step-by-step solutions using algorithms
- **Code Implementation**: Translating algorithms into a programming language

Python is an excellent first language because of its readable syntax and versatility. It's used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and more.`

    {
      title: "Variables and Data Types",
      content: `Variables are containers that store data values. Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare variable types explicitly.

**Core Data Types:**
- **int**: Integers (whole numbers)
- **float**: Floating-point numbers (decimals)
- **str**: Strings (text)
- **bool**: Boolean values (True/False)
- **list**: Ordered collections of items
- **dict**: Key-value pairs

**Naming Conventions:**
- Use descriptive names: \`student_grade\` instead of \`sg\`
- Use snake_case for variables and functions
- Constants should be UPPER_CASE`
