// NOTE FOR FUTURE AI:
// When defining lesson sections with code blocks, always use unescaped backticks (`) to open and close the template literal string.
// All triple backticks for code blocks inside the string must be escaped (\`\`\`).
// For example:
//   content: `Some text...\n\`\`\`python\ncode here\n\`\`\``
// This convention avoids accidental termination of the template literal and is the required style for all lessons in this codebase.

      title: "Understanding Machine Learning",
      content: `Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve automatically from experience without being explicitly programmed for every task.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying regularities in data
- **Prediction**: Making informed guesses about future or unknown data
- **Generalization**: Applying learned patterns to new, unseen data
- **Feature Extraction**: Identifying relevant characteristics in data

**Why Machine Learning Matters:**
- **Automation**: Automates complex decision-making processes
- **Scalability**: Handles massive datasets that humans can't process
- **Personalization**: Creates customized experiences (Netflix recommendations, social media feeds)
- **Innovation**: Enables breakthrough technologies like autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis`

      title: "Types of Machine Learning",
      content: `Machine learning approaches can be categorized into three main types:

**1. Supervised Learning**
- **Definition**: Learning with labeled training data (input-output pairs)
- **Examples**: Email spam detection, medical diagnosis, stock price prediction

**2. Unsupervised Learning**
- **Definition**: Finding hidden patterns in data without labeled examples
- **Examples**: Customer segmentation, data compression, anomaly detection

**3. Reinforcement Learning**
- **Definition**: Learning through interaction with an environment using rewards/penalties
- **Examples**: Game AI (AlphaGo), autonomous driving, trading algorithms`
