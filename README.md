## New Features

### Relevance Engine Preview Mode

The Relevance Engine page (`/relevance-engine`) now supports a preview mode for non-authenticated users:

- **Preview Mode**: Non-signed-in users can generate lesson plans to see what the platform offers
- **Full Lesson Content**: Users can view complete lesson plans with sections and content
- **Sign-in Prompts**: Clear calls-to-action encourage users to sign in to save their progress
- **Seamless Transition**: Once signed in, users can save and manage their lesson plans

#### How it works:
1. Visit `/relevance-engine` without signing in
2. Enter any trending topic (e.g., "AI replacing human jobs")
3. Click "Explore" to generate a preview lesson plan
4. View the complete lesson content and historical connections
5. Sign in when ready to save and access advanced features

#### Technical Implementation:
- `GenerateTopicLessonModal` component supports `previewMode` prop
- LLM API endpoints work without authentication for preview generation
- Preview banner clearly indicates when users are in preview mode
- Save buttons are replaced with sign-in prompts for non-authenticated users
